            <h3>Aggie Professor Search</h3>
            <p>Constructed a full-stack web application for Texas A&M Students to better gauge classes they want to take, by
                allowing them to view Professors GPA distribution, and rating, per ratemyprofessors.com.
                Implemented the python libraries Selenium and scrapy to scrape the Texas A&M Grade distributions website, and
                Ratemyprofessors.com. Utilized React to create the front-end portion of the website.
                Solved the problem of having to visit multiple websites and having multiple pages open to view data on the quality
                and difficulty at different classes at Texas A&M University</p>
